###### [1. A Novel Developer Ranking Algorithm for Automatic Bug Triage Using Topic Model and Developer Relations](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7091314)
- Authors: Tao Zhang, Geunseok Yang, Byungjeong Lee, Eng Keong Lua
- Institution: The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (香港理工大学, Tao Zhang), The University of Seoul (首尔大学, Geunseok Yang, Byungjeong Lee), NEC Laboratories (Japan,  Eng Keong Lua)
- Conference: APSEC
- Year: 2014
- Objective: Recommend <font color=red>the most suitable fixer</font> for software issues.
- Method: The proposed approaches combine <font color=red>topic model</font> and <font color=red>developer relations</font> (e.g., bug reporter and assignee) to <font color=red>capture developers’ interest</font> and experience on specific bug reports.
- Results: The experimental results reveal that our approach outperforms other recommendation methods for developers.

###### [2. Utilizing a multi-developer network-based developer recommendation algorithm to fix bugs effectively](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2555008)
- Authors:  	Geunseok Yang, Tao Zhang,  	Byungjeong Lee
- Institution: University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea (首尔大学)
- Conference: SAC '14 Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing
- Year: 2014
- Method:  We propose a novel algorithm for developer recommendation. We first introduce a component and a <font color=red>similar bug-based</font> selection process to verify the candidate fixers, then by adopting the number of <font color=red>comments and commits</font>, we construct a <font color=red>multi-developer network</font> so that ranking these candidates for finding the most appropriate fixer to resolve the given bug.
- Results: The result shows that our approach performs the task of bug triage effectively.

###### [3. TIPMerge: recommending developers for merging branches](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2983936)
- Authors:  	Catarina Costa,  	Jair Figueiredo,  	Anita Sarma,  	Leonardo Murta
- Institution: Federal University of Acre, Brazil (巴西联邦大学)
- Conference: FSE
- Year: 2016
- Why: Development in large projects often involves branches, where changes are performed in parallel and merged periodically. This merge process often combines two independent and long sequences of commits that may have been performed by multiple, different developers. <font color=red>It is nontrivial to identify the right developer to perform the merge</font>, as the developer must have enough understanding of changes in both branches to ensure that the merged changes comply with the objective of both lines of work (branches), which may have been active for <font color=red>several months</font>.
- Method:  We designed and developed TIPMerge, a novel tool that recommends developers who are best suited to <font color=red>perform the merge between two given branches</font>. TIPMerge does so by taking into consideration developers’ <font color=red>past experience in the project, <font color=red>their changes in the branches</font>, and the <font color=red>dependencies among modified files in the branches</font>.

###### [1. Developer recommendation for crowdsourced software development tasks](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7133552/)
- Authors: Ke Mao, Ye Yang, Qing Wang, Yue Jia, Mark Harman
- Institution: University College London (Ke Mao, Yue Jia, Mark Harman), Stevens Institute of Technology (斯蒂文斯理工学院 USA, Ye Yang), Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院,  Qing Wang)
- Conference: SOSE
- Year: 2015
- Objective: Automatically match tasks and developers for crowdsourced software development.
- Method: The approach learns particular interests from <font color=red>registration history</font> and mines <font color=red>winner history</font> to favour appropriate developers.
- Results: The evaluation results show that <font color=red>promising accuracy</font> and <font color=red>diversity</font> are achievable. We also <font color=red>provide advice</font> extracted from our results to guide the crowdsourcing platform in building a recommender system in practice.

###### [2. A learning to rank framework for developer recommendation in software crowdsourcing](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7467312)
- Authors: Jiangang Zhu, Beijun Shen, Fanghuai Hu
- Institution: Shanghai Jiao Tong University, East China University (华东理工大学, Fanghuai Hu)
- Conference: Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference
- Year: 2015
- Why: crowdsourcing has been widely used in
many tasks that computers are not good at such as image
recognition, entity resolution or some question answering tasks.People can deal with these tasks with
common sense knowledge. However, <font color=red>different from crowdsourcing
in a general domain, software crowdsourcing is more complex</font>.
- Method: Task characteristics learned
from <font color=red>their descriptions</font> and developer characteristic distributions
extracted from <font color=red>their historical tasks</font> are fed into our learning
to rank algorithms for developer recommendation together with
some other features such as <font color=red>topic-based features</font>.
- Results: The experimental results
show that our approach is feasible and effective.

- Authors: Wei Shao, Xiaoning Wang, and Wenpin Jiao
- Institution: Peking University
- Conference: NASAC
- Year: 2016
- Method: We present a
feature model to depict software crowdsourcing tasks and accordingly propose a
recommendation framework to recommend developers in CSD by combining a
<font color=red>neural network</font> and a <font color=red>content-based method</font>.
- Results: Our approach <font color=red>increases the accuracy</font> more than two times besides
having a pretty <font color=red>good extendibility</font>.

###### [1. Reviewer recommendation for pull-requests in Github: What can we learn from code review and bug assignment](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584916000069)
- Authors: Yue Yu, Huaimin Wang, Gang Yin, Tao Wang  
- Institution: National University of Defense Technology (国防科技大学)
- Journal: Information and Software Technology
- Year: 2016
- Why:
  - With <font color=red>pull-requests</font> becoming increasingly popular, the need for <font color=red>qualified  reviewers</font> also increases.
  - GitHub facilitates this, by enabling the <font color=red>crowd-sourcing</font> of pull-request reviews to a larger community of coders than just the project’s core team, as a part of their social coding philosophy.
  - However, having access to more potential reviewers <font color=red>does not necessarily mean that it’s easier to find the right ones</font>.
- Objective: This study aims to investigate whether and how previous approaches used in bug triaging and <font color=red>code review can be adapted to recommending reviewers for pull-requests</font>, and how to <font color=red>improve the recommendation performance</font>.
- Method:
  - We extend three typical approaches used in bug triaging and code review for the new challenge of assigning reviewers to pull-requests.
  - We analyze <font color=red>social relations between contributors and reviewers</font>, and propose a novel approach by <font color=red>mining each project’s comment networks (CNs)</font>.
  - We combine the CNs with traditional approaches, and evaluate the effectiveness of all these methods on <font color=red>84 GitHub projects</font> through both quantitative and qualitative analysis.
- Results: CN-based recommendation can achieve, by itself, similar performance as the traditional approaches. However, <font color=red>the mixed approaches can achieve significant improvements</font> compared to using either of them independently.

- Conference: SANER
- Year: 2015
- Why: Little research is known the difficulty of finding code-reviewers in a distributed software development and its impact on <font color=red>reviewing time</font>.
- Objective: Find appropriate code-reviewers.
- Method: We propose REVFINDER, a <font color=red>file location-based</font> code-reviewer recommendation approach.
- Results: REVFINDER accurately recommended <font color=red>79% of reviews with a top 10 recommendation</font>. The overall ranking of REVFINDER is <font color=red>3 times better</font> than that of a baseline approach.

###### [3. Automatically recommendation peer reviewers in  modern code review](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7328331/)
- Authors: Motahareh Bahrami Zanjani, Huzefa Kagdi, Christian Bird
- Institution:  Wichita State University (US, 威奇塔州立大學), Microsoft Research (Christian Bird)
- Journal: IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
- Year: 2016
- Objective: Recommend reviewers who are best suited to participate in a given review
- Method: recommend reviewers who are best suited to participate in a given review, based on their <font color=red>historical contributions</font> as demonstrated in
their prior reviews.
- Results:  We show that by leveraging the specific information in
previously completed reviews (i.e.,quantification of review comments and their recency), we are able to improve dramatically on the
performance of prior approaches, which (limitedly) operate on <font color=red>generic review information (i.e., reviewers of similar source code file and
path names) or source coderepository data</font>. We also present the <font color=red>insights</font> into why our approach
cHRev
outperforms the existing
approaches.
